Note: Example was based on data set HDHGC3


spks.time = spike times in seconds
spks.channel = electrode channel of the corresponding spikes 



burstlet.t0s=the time of which a burstlet was detected 
burstlet.start = the spks # that denotes the start of the burstlet
burstlet.end = the spks # that denotes the end of the burstlet

example: for the first burstlet
burstlet.start(1) =1   
burstlet.end(1)=7 
the start time of the burstlet = spks.time(1) -> 0.4621s  
the end time of the burstlet = spks.time(7) -> 0.6149s 

burstlet.cnts= no. of spike contained in each burstlet
for the above example, burstlet.cnts(1)=7

burstlet.channel= the electrode channel from which the particular burstlet is detected
for the above example, burstlet.channel(1)=2  -> the first burstlet was detected from electrode 2



burst.t0=the time of the burst
burst.mn=the start time of the burst
burst.mx=the end time of the burst
burst.spikecount=total no. of spikes contained in the burst
burst.chcnt=total no. of electrode channels involved in the burst

burst.index= the burst # of the burstlet 
example: burst.index(1:50)==1 -> the first 50 burstlets belong to burst #1

burst.channel= the electrode channel of which the burstlet was detected

burst.burstlet = the no. in "burstlet".mat"
example: burst.burstlet(1)=1 is the 1st. element in "burstlet.mat"
         burst.burstlet(2)=1003 is the 1003rd. element in "burstlet.mat"
